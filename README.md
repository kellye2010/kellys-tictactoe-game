Planning

I planned by writing out user stories/scenarios and UI wireframes. While the popular game of Tic-Tac-Toe as a game is widely understood, I looked at current Tic-Tac-Toe apps out on the web to play a few rounds. I did this to get an idea of some of the things that need to happen in the background that the average game player wouldnâ€™t need to think about as they make their every move.

Development

I focused on the logic and functionality of the Tic-Tac-Game first. I started by creating the authentication, which included a sign-up, sign-in, login, logout, and change of password. Next I began creating the UI for the board itself in my index.html and .cscc files. Once the board was created, I began putting together the login, starting with users being able to click a square on the game board, and the game board would respond by displaying either an X or an O, with X being the first game token, followed by O.

Takeaways

Planning with respect to requirements will always be the most important part of any development. Taking the time and necessary steps to plan everything early will save time later.
